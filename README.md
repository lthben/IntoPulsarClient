# IntoPulsarClient
Code for an Espresso Lite ver 2 ESP8266 board.

For a Night Festival 2016 installation at the National Museum of Singapore 
called 'Into Pulsar' by artist Ryf Zaini.

Three bicycles placed at the bottom of a 'tree'. User cycles any of these to trigger the 
28 x ebike wheels on top of the tree to go faster to show a pov image on the 
4 led strips placed in a "+" pattern on the wheels. 

This code is a WiFi client receiving an analog data value from a server. The 28 ebikes on 
the tree are clients to the single Espresso board at the bottom of the tree acting as server.
